abstract: HealthSearch provides a powerful, robust hospital searching and ranking tool in a clean, functional, and easy-to-use package. It surpasses similar tools by including over 50 hospital quality metrics, putting patient experience at the forefront of our measures, employing the sophisticated latent variable technique to account for potentially hidden variables affecting hospital quality, and offering a personalizable algorithm, accessible through a convenient user-interface, which weights factors based on user preference. We believe HealthSearch can enable patients to take control over their own healthcare and provide them with much-welcomed autonomy in a system which has long treated patients as mere numbers.
